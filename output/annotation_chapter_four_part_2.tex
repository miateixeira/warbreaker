\section{Annotation Chapter Four Part 2}

\subsection*{Hawaii}

Why, yes, I did visit Hawaii in the middle of writing this book. Did you notice?

Following \textit{Mistborn}, I wanted to do a book set in a place that looked \textit{very} different from the Final Empire. What’s different from a burned-out wasteland? Why, a tropical paradise of course! One of the great things about being an author is the ability to justify going to Hawaii just so I could do research on how to properly describe the plants, landscape, and atmosphere in a place like that. It’s really a tough job, but I’m willing to sacrifice for you all. No need to thank me.

\subsection*{Undead}

I’d been toying for a long time with doing a book with “technological” undead in a fantasy world. A place where a body could be recycled, restored to a semblance of life, then set to work. I’m always looking for ways to explore new ground in fantasy, and I’ve seen people sticking to the same old tropes with undead. (Mindless, rotting zombies or dynamic, goth-dressed vampires.)

I wanted to play with a middle ground. If you’ve got a magic that can make a stick figure come to life, what could it do with a dead body? How could a society make use of these walking corpses, treating them as a realistic resource?

The Lifeless grew out of this desire. I developed something like them for use earlier in a completely different novel, but I abandoned that plan years ago. They returned to the scrap pile of my mind, from which I draw forth and recombine ideas to create novels.

\subsection*{Other Notes}

Yes, there are Returned in Idris. There are Returned everywhere in this world that there are people. (The name of this world is Nalthis, by the way. \textit{Mistborn} takes place on a world called Scadrial, and \textit{Elantris} on a world known as Sel. See the fun things you learn by reading annotations?)

I’d like someday to do a sequel to \textit{Warbreaker}, in part because I want to show off all of the different ways people in Nalthis deal with the Returned. They’re treated in very strange ways some places. For instance, just across the mountains there’s a kingdom where when someone dies in a way that might be heroic, the corpse is immediately purchased by a nobleman hoping to hit the jackpot and get a Returned. You see, since Returned can heal people, keeping one around to act as an emergency insurance plan to restore your health is a great idea.

Also, just in case you’re wondering, the Bright Sea and the Inner Sea are both the same place. It’s another Idris/Hallandren thing. Most mountains, oceans, and lakes have two names—the Idrian one and the Hallandren one. Originally, this happened because there was bad blood between the two kingdoms, so they’d call things different names in order to differentiate themselves. Ironically, in a lot of cases both names have stuck, and both kingdoms have found themselves alternating between the two names.

Inner Sea was the Idrian name for the body of water, renamed because they wanted to downplay how important it was. (Idris is landlocked, after all.) Bright Sea was the original name.
