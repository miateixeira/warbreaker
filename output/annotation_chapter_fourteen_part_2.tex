\section{Annotation Chapter Fourteen Part 2}

\subsection*{Vivenna Enters the Court}

Color harmonics are one of the things in this book that, I think, have some very interesting philosophical implications. I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of perfect pitch. Pitches and tones are an absolute; music isn’t just something we humans devise and construct out of nothing. It’s not arbitrary. Like mathematics, music is based on principles greater than human intervention in the world. Someone with perfect pitch can recognize pure tones, and they exist outside of our perception and division of them. (Unlike something like our appreciation of other kinds of art, which is dealing with things that are far more subjective.)

However, I wondered if—perhaps—there are perfect steps of colors just like there are perfect tones, with color fifths, sevenths, and chords and the like. In our world, nobody has the ability to distinguish these things—but what if there were someone who could? Someone who could tell something innate about color that isn’t at all subjective?

I’m not sure if I explained that right, but it intrigued me enough to become part of this book.

\subsection*{Different Viewpoints in the Same Chapter}

In the \textit{Mistborn} books, most of the characters were either involved in the same plotline or separated from one another by distance. I missed being able to do what I did in \textit{Elantris}, where I would show an event from the perspectives of characters who were involved in very different storylines.

The characters in \textit{Warbreaker} are a little more focused on the same things, and are tied together by plots, but they’re also very separate. (At least at the beginning.) It’s fun for me as a writer to be able to show Lightsong, Vivenna, and Siri all attending the same event, but drawing very different experiences from it.
