\subsection*{Siri Rides South, Stunned}

Already, you should be able to see another tone shift in the book. We’ve gone from lazy highland romping to frustration and terror. My goal with this book was to keep that up—to always have things moving and the characters being pulled out of their comfortable lives into situations that force them to stretch.

One fun thing you can research yourself by looking at the first draft chapters of \textit{Warbreaker} I posted. In them, I toyed with having Mab the cook be sent with Siri to be a lady’s maid.

I didn’t intend this while planning the book, but after writing Mab—and having so much fun with her character—I wanted to keep hold of her and let her add some color to Siri’s sections. However, I cut this idea out pretty quickly. (Though a draft of this chapter exists with Mab accompanying Siri—I think in that draft, Mab is the one Siri is complaining to, rather than the poor guard outside the window.)

Why cut Mab? Well, a couple of reasons. First off, Siri’s plotline was much more dramatic and emotional if she was forced to leave behind everything she’d known. Giving her a support character like Mab undermined Siri’s plot and growth as a character. Beyond that, Siri’s plots didn’t \textit{need} more color. We’ve got plenty of interesting characters and experiences coming for her, so the addition of another character wasn’t needed.

I tried the chapter, but then realized that my original instincts had been right. I was forced to cut Mab out.

\subsection*{Character Shifts}

This is a fun chapter, formatwise. It looks simple—we’ve got two alternating sequences with Siri and Vivenna. But what’s going on here is that I’m trying to pull the first of many reversals in this book.

A reversal is more than just a plot twist—it’s a swap. (Or at least that’s how I define it in my head.) Just like \textit{Elantris}’s substructure was that of the chapter triads, \textit{Warbreaker}’s substructure is that of reversals. People change places or do 180-degree turns. This presented a challenge to me, as I had to work hard to make such often-abrupt changes well foreshadowed and rational. That’s rather difficult to pull off. Most twists take characters in a slightly new direction; spinning them around completely required a lot more groundwork.

If you’ve read other annotations of mine, you’ll probably know that I love twists—but I love them only in that I love to make them \textit{work}. A good twist has to be rational and unexpected at the same time. Pulling off that balance is one of the great pleasures in writing.

In this chapter, we have the beginnings of the first big reversal in this book. It’s more gradual—not an abrupt one-eighty, but a slow and purposeful one-eighty. But the seeds are here, even in this early chapter. If you look at it, we have this:

Scene One: Siri acts just like we expect Siri to. Blustering and emotional.

Scene Two: Vivenna acts just like we expect Vivenna to. Calm, rational, in control, and willing to do as she is told.

Scene Three: Siri grows calm, considers her situation with more care, and acts a little bit like a queen should in deciding to send her soldiers back.

Scene Three: Vivenna is very bothered by what is happening and acts just a little bit like Siri would—she decides upon a plan that is impetuous.

I’m very excited by the underlying structure of the chapter, even though I’m aware that most people probably wouldn’t be. I’m just a screwy author type.

I like how the changes are very subtle, and yet already there are hints at the way the characters are heading in life.

I like reversals and tone changes, but I still think that readers deserve to have an understanding of what the major plots and arcs for a character will be. There will be twists, but I don’t want to just twist needlessly or endlessly. The characters are the most important part of the story, and one thing I rarely twist (particularly late in a book) is a character’s personal arc. I keep personal arcs steady, as they’re the foundation of a reader’s attachment to the book.

\subsection*{Vivenna and Her Father Chat about Siri}

King Dedelin does love Siri. He’s a good man, but not quite as great a man as his daughters probably think. He \textit{does} put Vivenna first. He loves her more. Perhaps because he relates to her; the two of them are very similar in many ways.

The girls’ mother passed away over a decade ago, by the way, in a riding accident. Siri doesn’t remember it, but Vivenna does, and that is one of the sources of tension between them. Siri’s flagrant rides remind both Vivenna and her father of the way the queen died. Memory of their mother is also part of what makes Vivenna more controlled and “perfect.” Siri grew up with very little supervision, while Vivenna had much more of it in the person of her mother.

Anyway, Dedelin loves Vivenna more. When he says that he sent Siri, “Not because of personal preference, whatever people say,” he’s being truthful as he sees things—but he’s deluding himself. He’s convinced himself that he did it primarily because Vivenna’s leadership is important to Idris and she can’t be risked. That is important to him, true, but his love for Vivenna is the primary reason.

Now, he’s not callous or hateful of Siri. He loves her. But . . . well, Vivenna reminds him of his wife. I guess you can’t blame the guy too much for what he did.

\subsection*{Vivenna Picks Berries}

One aspect of the worldbuilding I barely get to talk about is the Idrian monks. I really liked the concept of a group of monks whose duties weren’t very religious. Rather than sitting in a monastery all day, their duties are essentially to act as servants to the kingdom’s poor. (Not to say that monks in our world don’t do that. However, I liked the concept of it being much more formalized.)

In Idris, if a man breaks his leg and can’t work the field, a monk will come and take his place on the job. The wages for that work still go to the family of the man who has been hurt. Sometimes, if a father dies and cannot support his family, a monk is assigned permanently to take his place at work duties and provide for that man’s family.

They go wherever they are needed, forbidden to own or possess anything themselves, giving all they have to the people. Now, of course, not everyone who becomes a monk fits the ideal. Without the pressures of needing to feed one’s self or acquire goods, some of them can be kind of lazy. But many are very diligent, like Fafen.

\subsection*{One Last Note on Reversals}

We have a nice moment in this chapter rotating around a single word. Siri begins the chapter thinking about how she was supposed to be useless, and how she wishes that she still were. Then Vivenna ends her section thinking about how she’s \textit{become} useless. That terrifies her.
