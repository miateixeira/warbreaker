\subsection*{Bluefingers Warns Siri Outside the God King’s Chamber}

I’ll admit that many of Siri’s thoughts here are complaints I myself have. She wonders why Bluefingers had to be so cryptic. It’s a weak literary device, in my opinion, always having people with knowledge tease with it but never give the full truth. I hate it when I read stories where characters withhold information just because it needs to be withheld in the book.

At the same time, the only way to have a mystery is for there to be things the characters don’t know. There can be legitimate reasons why someone doesn’t want to speak or share what they know. In my books, I want those reasons to be good ones—which is why in the Alcatraz books, I never have the adults refrain from giving Alcatraz information just because of his age.

In this case, Bluefingers has very, very good reasons for what he does. I hope that it doesn’t feel contrived for him not to speak further here.

\subsection*{The God King Approaches Siri in Bed}

Siri wonders why the God King wears black, rather than white—which his BioChroma would distort. The answer is simple. To Awakeners, black is a symbol of power. It’s a fuel, a color that can be used for Awakening. White, however, is useless. So to wear white would be foolish, except in certain cases where the priests want to prove how powerful the God King is by letting him dynamically bend the light. So while he occasionally appears in white, his everyday attire is black.

His ability to bend light into the prismatic colors, by the way, was added about halfway through the first draft. I wanted a stronger visual indication of someone who had reached the top Heightenings, and I like the imagery associated with it.

\subsection*{The God King Has No Tongue}

Okay, so here we have the first major reversal in the book. There are several reasons I wanted to write this story. The first was that I loved the concept of the woman being sent to the terrible emperor, only to discover that he was a puppet of someone else. This was a big part of the original \textit{Mythwalker} plot for Siri, and was a big part of what intrigued me about that story. (As a side note, \textit{Mythwalker} was also the first place where I tried out the words \textit{koloss} and \textit{skaa} for races. They were completely different then, however.)

After writing \textit{Mistborn}, I became increasingly intrigued with the idea of a complete reversal book—a book that did things very differently from the way I’d done them before. I’d dealt with an all-powerful emperor, and so people would (unconsciously) expect the God King here to be like the Lord Ruler. That gave me more opportunity to use their expectations against them and pull off a reversal of roles like the one in this chapter.

I hope it worked. By now, you were probably suspecting that something odd was up with the God King. However, I hope you weren’t expecting something as redefining as the lack of a tongue. In this society, with this magic system, that is an even greater symbol of powerlessness than it would be in our society.
